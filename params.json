But it is a free (as in freedom) computer, or at least a seed for one. Free computers are necessary for GNUsers, since [the GNU freedoms must include hardware to make any sense](http://blogg.hioa.no/alfred/2013/03/03/the-gnu-freedoms-must-include-hardware-to-make-any-sense/). \r\n\r\n###What it's currently supposed to be:\r\n- A C++ implementation of a Turing complete register machine\r\n- Very small\r\n- Extremely inefficient\r\n\r\n###What it's supposed to become:\r\n- A pysically implementable computer\r\n  - using a small subset of the x86 instruction set\r\n  - With basic interrupt support\r\n  - Serial-like I/O ports, each supporting interrupts\r\n  - Probably no interrupt timer, except over serial I/O\r\n- A functioning virtual machine\r\n- Extremely small, but maybe less extremely inefficient\r\n\r\n###Why does size matter?\r\nBecause if you really want to [control your own computing](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) you have to be able to read, and understand the source code of both your software and your hardware, in less than a lifetime. That's usually very optimistic.\r\n\r\ngnx86 has nothing to do with GNU, except that it considers it a friend.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
